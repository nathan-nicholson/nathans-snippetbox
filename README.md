# nathans-snippetbox

Working through the book ["Let's Go"](https://lets-go.alexedwards.net/) by Alex Edwards. This is a simple web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete snippets of text. I'm riffing on the book's project with the intent of making it a bit more robust and production-ready as an exercise. Things I'm considering:

- [ ] Dockerize the application
- [ ] Add task automation with act
- [ ] Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] Add observability with Prometheus and Grafana
- [ ] Add logging with Loki
- [ ] Add secrets management with Vault
- [ ] Add deployment automation with ArgoCD

## Docker Setup
